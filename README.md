Beginners Guide to Revel Tek

#WHAT's TIMMSI LAND: 
The mission of Timmsi Land is to have people build entire worlds and tell them they can crash worlds. They can crash launches.

They can build droids, crash the Droid, break the Droid, and it's just a playground for all of that.

GRADING SYSTEM:

The division of the levels of those 15 grades and how droids fit in on in these 15 grades. That will all sit in teams C land. ###READ WHAT REVEL TEK WANTS?

DROID:

- D.R.O.I.D Ops is a methodology that our company, uses to approach technology solutions for our clients. It stands for Design, Research, Optimize, Integrate, and Deliver. This methodology allows us to provide a comprehensive approach to our projects, ensuring that we cover all aspects of the solution.

- One of the benefits of using D.R.O.I.D Ops is that it helps us maintain a high level of collaboration, communication, and creative thinking throughout the project. We also follow agile/lean philosophy, which means that we are able to adapt to changes quickly and efficiently.

#What Revel Tek Wants:
- The Droid is just 25% of the entire orbital Mission Control. What we really want people to do is launch entire orbitals and have that orbital be completely self-sustaining.

The grading system should reflect the entire orbital system, not just the droid's portion.
Just an engineer can build a Droid, but an operative should be able to launch an entire Droid, build an entire world. We don't want people that can only.
Do a little bit of tinkering on engineering. We want to attract people that can do.
Thing that can build entire world and to breakdown what I mean by a world. You know, Facebook is a World Food. Panda is a whole world. It's a whole ecosystem.
It's not just one widget.
Whoever built food panda, they built an entire delivery system, marketing program company. It's everything combined and we want to give the tools and the training so that people can build something like that.




#QUICK SUMMARY:
Revel Tek want every indiual to have fun, fun in a sense that they have the caliber to start a droid( D.R.O.I.D Ops is a methodology that our company, uses to approach technology solutions for our clients. It stands for Design, Research, Optimize, Integrate, and Deliver. This methodology allows us to provide a comprehensive approach to our projects, ensuring that we cover all aspects of the solution.)

Where they can built droid, destroy it and then again rebuild it, just like an LEGO BLOCKS, whact actually we want that our new timmsi land players do not hesitate to make mistakes.

After words they have they experties to lauch their own droids, just like Biryani, in which different droids comes together like Rice,( Science behind it's creation) , spices( what's behind them, how they created), chicken/beef/mutton etc, and then combining together they form an orbital and after that they have a shape of ecosystem having different flavours.

OR If we take an TECH EXAMPLE:

REVEL TEK wants to form such  a system where an indiual make droids, turn them into orbitals,  and an complete ECO-SYSTEM, which needs ZERO maintainace or can run for a long term without in need of conitnues energy input.
